# STORE & PRODUCTS
This was a project that involved more practice with OOP and relational data structures.
### Objectives:
* update_price(self, percent_change, is_increased) - updates the product's price. If is_increased is True, the price should increase by the percent_change provided. If False, the price should decrease by the percent_change provided.
* print_info(self) - print the name of the product, its category, and its price.
* add_product(self, new_product) - takes a product and adds it to the store
* sell_product(self, id) - remove the product from the store's list of products given the id (assume id is the index of the product in the list) and print its info.
* inflation(self, percent_increase) - increases the price of each product by the percent_increase given (use the method you wrote in the Product class!)
* set_clearance(self, category, percent_discount) - updates all the products matching the given category by reducing the price by the percent_discount given (use the method you wrote in the Product class!)
